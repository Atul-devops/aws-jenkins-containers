:toc:

This reference architecture demonstrates how to leverage a single delivery pipeline to deploy to multiple orchestrators. This example will show how to simultanesouly deploy to both
ECS and Kubernetes. This demonstration could be used to deploy to hybrid scenario where you have Kubernetes on premises and ECS in the cloud. Alternatively it could also be use to deploy to
homogenous clusters in different regions.

=== Pre-Requisites

A fucntioning Kubernetes cluster and config file to authenticate to the cluster, by default this is located at `~/.kube/config`

A functioning ECS cluster, Setup an ECR repository, build the docker container push to repo. Create a service.

Fork github repository. Setup Jenkins. Modify Security Group to allow traffic from GitHub, setup GitHub hook.

http://<IPADDRESS>/github-webhook/

Install pip, awscli, github (or use vanilla amazon linux ami and install just docker)

=== Deploy the CloudFormation stack

=== Prepare ec2 instance

Clone Repository

    git clone https://github.com/omarlari/aws-jenkins-containers.git

Create directory for jenkins data and kube config

    mkdir ~/jenkins-data
    mkdir ~/.kube

Build awscli and kubectl images

    cd aws-jenkins-containers
    docker build -f AWSCLI -t awscli .
    docker build -f KUBECTL -t kubectl .

SCP Kube credentials to instance

    scp ~/.kube/config ec2-user@<yourip>:~/.kube

Test awscli and kubectl

    docker run awscli s3 ls
    docker run -v /home/ec2-user/.kube:/config/.kube kubectl get nodes

Start Jenkins

    chmod u+x ~/aws-jenkins-containers/start-jenkins.sh
    sudo ~/aws-jenkins-containers/start-jenkins.sh

=== Configure Jenkins

Once you have started the jenkins container launch a browser to the IP address of the ec2 instance, you will be presented with the following screen:

image::jenkins-getting-started.png[jenkins]

Retrieve the initial credentials from the jenkins container:

    docker ps
    docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
    cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    exit

Go ahead and copy and paste this into Jenkins to start the Jenkins configuration.

On the customize Jenkins screen, select "Install suggested plugins"

image::jenkins-customize.png[jenkins]

Next you will be prompted to create your first Jenkins user, if you want to avoid using the initial credentials go ahead and create an admin user:

image::jenkins-first-admin.png[jenkins]

You should be presented with this screen and we can finish the Jenkins configuration:

image::jenkins-ready.png[jenkins]

Next let's add the ECR plugin. On the left hand screen click 'Manage Jenkins' > 'Manage Plugins', on the 'Available' tab filter for 'Amazon ECR plugin' and install it.

This will install the following plugins:

Amazon Web Services SDK
CloudBees Amazon Web Service Credentials Plugin
Amazon ECR plugin

Go ahead and click the check-box on the bottom to restart Jenkins and then log back in.

=== Configure Pipeline Job

First we need to add ECR credentials into the Jenkins system


=== Configure Jenkins Job
